## The Tricolor Algorithm
...
Most modern programming languages have some form of automated garbage collection mechanism that takes up the tasks of memory management on behalf of the programmer. This typically happens by identifying objects that are no longer referenced by the program in execution and marking them for removal. The heap space of the memory must be recycled because, in the process of program execution, the entire memory may be used up unless garbage is collected in time.

Garbage collection in Go is based upon tricolor algorithms. This algorithm is the backbone for many other languages as well. This Go programming tutorial explains the concept behind tricolor algorithms and how Golang uses it to implement garbage collection mechanisms.
